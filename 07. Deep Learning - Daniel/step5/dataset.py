        #
        # Use scikit-learn's new `fetch_openml` function to download
        # the dataset given by `self.name`.  The function returns a
        # bunch object with two attributes, `dataset.data` and
        # `dataset.target`.  You can print these to see what they look
        # like.  Also print their shape, for example:
        #
        #   print(dataset.data.shape)
        #   print(dataset.target.shape)
        #
        # The `__call__` method that we implement here is supposed to
        # return a tuple of (X, y), where X is a NxM feature matrix
        # and y a target vector of size n.
